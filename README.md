# Simple String Operations
Create solu+on for the following tasks. Wri+ng unit tests will be part of your a8ernoon
lab work. However, if you want an extra challenge, try TDD.
1. Given a list of words (strings) return the 3 most common and the 3 least common
   words. Op+onal, read the words from a file.
2. Write a method that returns true if a string is a palindrome ( a word, phrase or
   sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards – i.e. madam or nurses run)
3. Write a method that can determine whether a string is made up from unique
   characters. Op+onal, write a version that doesn’t use addi+onal data structures)
